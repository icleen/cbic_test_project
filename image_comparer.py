    the other and normalize, giving me an image where similar atributes
    have been subtracted out. I then threshold the resulting image, making
    each value a one or zero, and sum the result, which gives me the value
    for intersection. This is more rubust than simply calculating the
    intersection by summing the number of pixels that are exactly the same
    between images. Below I save out images that show the intermediary steps,
